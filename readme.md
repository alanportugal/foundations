# Assignment 3 Details

In your 'Portfolio' or 'week2' directory, create a directory called 'styles' and within it, a file called first-stylesheet.css. In this stylesheet, write some styling for your portfolio site. This file must have at least 50 lines of code. Use your awesome design skillz or just experiment. This assignment is about using CSS properly, not design. 

Include a link to the stylesheet in the head section of each of the html pages. This would also be a good opportunity to add more content to these HTML pages.

Use git to commit your work as you go. Push your work up to your Github repository's master branch. Create a new branch called gh-pages, and test your creation. Submit a link on Canvas to the URL for your GH Page (username.github.io/reponame), and add a comment with your Github repository for this assignment.

We will view the pages via your personal Github Pages URL and expect everything to be functional (no broken images or links, etc). Refer to Lesson 0's slides if you need a refresher on Git & Github.
